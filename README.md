# Welcome to the Society of Chromophobics
In this puzzle game you have the role of an Event Planner for the dinner of the Society of Chromophobics. 

Your task is to assign all the guests to chairs at the tables in such a way that no phobia is triggered.

This game is a post-compo sequel of the game I made for the js13k 2024 edition, see https://github.com/mxlle/13k-triskaidekaphobia
